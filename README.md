# Canton Network "Updates" Visualiser

Proof of Concept of an Updates Visualiser for Canton Network.

Canton Network provides a privacy-enabled distributed ledger for major financial services. As part of the service, 
Canton Network uses a utility token - Canton Coin. The network exposes transaction in Canton Coin through a Scan service
and an associated API.

Canton Coin is an example of an Amulet token as defined by the models here:
